# FreeBSD 4.8 - 4.11 KLD templates

This repository is here as proof the rest of kernel modules in my sandbox
are authentic.

In particular, the standard syscall example (as could be found in a stock FreeBSD
distribution under /usr/share/examples/kld/syscall) contains the copyrights by 
 Assar Westerlund.

I used the axample extensively for my other FreeBSD KLDs, without ever changing
the copyrights or license.

Even less am I tempted to change these in my own modules now, after 10 years have passed.

So, here it is.
